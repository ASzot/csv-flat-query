# Tea-time
A simple and easy system for working with time series financial data from CSV files. This system saves you the headache and performance drawback of loading many CSV files into memory. 

For details go to my blog post on this project
[here](https://www.andrewszot.com/blog/quant_finance/software/streaming_flat_csv_db). 

Currently only daily data is supported. I will add support for minute data
either if it is needed by me or someone else.
